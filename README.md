# Bill-Management-System
It is designed to add and delete products purchased by the customer into the shopping bill.The code is also capable of generating the total bill amount taking the quantity of the product purchased into consideration.

This project is made using SQL and Python. Some notable features of the project include -

1. Supermarket has a number of customers showing up at different dates and times. The same customer can also revisit on a different date or time.
   
2. We create one table per shopping bill generated i.e. per customer visit.
   
3. Table name is a combination of customer name, visit date and visit time.
   
4. Final output is the total bill generated taking quantity of each product into account.
